          Workers have been protesting for more than a day in front of the
          Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) in Savar demanding the payment
          of overdue wages from two garment factories—Lenny Fashion and Lenny
          Apparels—that closed down four years ago. The protests started
          around 7:30am yesterday, and have continued intermittently until at
          least 2:00pm today, when this story was filed. Google News LinkFor
          all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The
          protesters also blocked the Nabinagar-Chandra highway several times
          during the demonstration today, Sarwar Alam, superintendent of
          Ashulia Industrial Police-1, told The Daily Star. Following the
          blockade, traffic movement on both sides of the road came to a halt,
          creating a severe traffic jam. However, law enforcers maintained
          presence at the scene. According to the protesters, though the
          factories were shut four years ago, they have not been paid yet. The
          Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) are not keeping
          their promises despite repeatedly setting dates for payment. They
          will continue the protest if their dues are not paid, the workers
          said. SP Sarwar said that efforts are on to persuade the workers to
          leave the busy road. He added that BEPZA so far gave four dates to
          them but could not be able to pay the dues. Anwar Parvez, BEPZA's
          executive director (public relations), said that the two factories
          are owned by the same owner and initiatives have been taken to pay
          the dues of the two factories' workers together. Due to some legal
          complications, there is still no scope to give the money. Workers have been protesting for more than a day in
